# Image_Processing
This project reconstructs color images from historical Prokudin‑Gorskii photo plates by splitting stacked grayscale scans into B, G, and R channels, aligning them using NCC or SSD (optionally with a multiscale pyramid), and enhancing the result with histogram equalization, gamma correction, and unsharp masking, plus automatic border cropping.
